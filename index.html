    This page contains information and the schedule for the Bath Visual Computing reading group and research seminar.
    Most weeks, two students will give two different types of presentation:
  </p>

  <h5>Reading Group</h5>
  <p>
    A short presentation (~10 minutes) and group discussion (~10 minutes) of a usually recent research paper that is relevant to a student’s research and of more general interest to the wider group.
    This can also be a quick survey of a field, e.g. based on your confirmation report.
    You can prepare slides, if you like, or present using an existing video and the paper.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Preparation:</u>
    Please send the title of your chosen paper and a link to the project or paper to the organiser the week before your presentation.
    The idea is to allow others to look at the paper prior to the reading group on Wednesday.
  </p>

  <h5>Research Seminar</h5>
  <p>
    This is a short presentation (~10 minutes) on a student’s current work in progress, including the motivation and goal of the project, as well as a discussion of current issues and next steps, followed by questions and answers from the group (~10 minutes).
  </p>

  <h5>Ground rules</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Timeslots were allocated randomly with manual tweaks to ensure at least 4 weeks between presentations by the same person.</li>
    <li>If a time is inconvenient for whatever reason, please find someone to swap with, who agrees to swap. Notify the organiser about the swap via email, ccing the other presenter.</li>
  </ol>
